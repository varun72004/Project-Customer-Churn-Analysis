📊 Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction
🔎 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a telecommunications company and building predictive models to identify at-risk customers. By understanding customer behavior and churn patterns, the project aims to deliver actionable insights and recommendations that help reduce churn and improve customer retention strategies.

The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory analysis, segmentation, and insightful visualizations to highlight key churn drivers.

⚠️ Note: Out of 6 possible tasks, this implementation covers 4 major tasks.

✅ Tasks Completed
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Handled missing values and outliers.

Encoded categorical variables into numerical formats (e.g., one-hot encoding).

Standardized and normalized numerical features for consistency.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Examined customer demographics, contract types, and service usage.

Identified key factors influencing churn.

Performed statistical summaries and correlation checks.

3. Customer Segmentation

Segmented customers based on tenure, monthly charges, and contract type.

Compared churn rates across different segments.

Highlighted high-risk groups for targeted interventions.

4. Visualizations

Created informative plots (box plots, histograms, heatmaps, etc.) to represent churn patterns.

Developed clear data-driven insights for decision-making.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📌 Key Insights

Customers with month-to-month contracts show the highest churn rate.

High monthly charges are strongly correlated with churn.

Long-term contracts (1- or 2-year) significantly reduce churn risk.

🚀 Outcomes

Identified at-risk customer groups through segmentation and EDA.

Built a strong foundation for predictive churn modeling.

Provided recommendations to improve retention strategies.
